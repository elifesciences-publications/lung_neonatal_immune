# Code used in Domingo-Gonzales, Zanini et al. on neonatal lung immune cells
To keep an eye on what we do: http://fabilab.org.

# Folder structure
`lungsc` contains the code in various subfolders:
- `pipeline` contatins the code used for mapping and gene counting
- `ingest` contains the code used for merging different sequencing runs, filtering, and packaging the gene counts, and for cell type and subtype annotation
- `figures_immune_paper` contains the scripts used in the figure making
- `supplementary` contains the scripts used to make various supplementary figures

Of course, contact Fabio Zanini or open an issue on this repository for access to more data or scripts.

This code is associated with the paper from Domingo-Gonzalez et al., "Diverse homeostatic and immunomodulatory roles of immune cells in the developing mouse lung at single cell resolution". eLife, 2020. http://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.56890
